Thank you for your interest in QED! Below is a quick guide on getting started as
a new contributor.

<Heading h3 icon={<RepoIcon size={24} />}>Find a project you like</Heading>

To get started, you can head over to our [GitHub page](https://github.com/orgs/qedhere/repositories).
On this page you will find and find a list of repositories that are available to
the public. From here you can simply pick a project that you
are interested in and dive right in!

<Heading h3 icon={<IssueOpenedIcon size={24} />}>Working on issues</Heading>

On each repository, there is an `issues` tab, where there are a list of todos
available for public help. If you are new to GitHub, you might look for the label
`good first issue`. Each issue can be linked to a [branch](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-branches)
which can be merged back to the main branch after said changes.

<Heading h3 icon={<GitPullRequestIcon size={24} />}>Submitting your changes</Heading>

After you have fixed the issue, you can create a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
and your changes will be submitted for review! ðŸŽ‰ If you are interested in the code review
process you can take a look at the [security documentation](/docs/security/code-reviews).
