Are you having a problem? Found a bug or issue? This is a short article regarding
how to report, and debug issues.

<Heading h3>Reporting Issues</Heading>

If you find something is not working as expected we encourage you to create an issue
as soon as possible. You can also head over to the organization-level [discussions](https://github.com/orgs/qedhere/discussions)
and start a thread in the Q&A section.

#### Duplicate Issues
Before you start a new issue, the first thing you should do is to check if someone else
has the same issue as you.

> 1. Search open **and closed** issues to see if you find a duplicate.
> 2. Search discussions to see if you can find a duplicate.
