<Heading h2>Documentation Format</Heading>

The QED documentation is writting in MarkdownX (`.mdx`) which is an extension of
standard markdown. An example markdown file may look like the following:

```md
import { Button } from "@docs/Button"

## Hello World!
This is some **markdown** and an inline React Component <Button/>
```

<Heading h3>Why MDX?</Heading>

MDX allows us to import re-usable react components into our documentation making
without removing the functionality of markdown.

<Heading h3>Features</Heading>

#### GFM (GitHub Flavored Markdown)
The documentation supports GitHub Flavored Markdown; here is a quick demo:


 | Syntax      | Description |
 | ----------- | ----------- |
 | Header      | Title       |
 | Paragraph   | Text        |

#### Syntax Highlighting
The documentation also highlights code blocks (as you can see above)

#### LaTeX
We can also render inline, and block math in the documentation. For example

```tex
$\frac{1}{2}$
```

gives us $\frac{1}{2}$. Block math can be done as shown below:

```tex
$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}
$$
```

$$
\zeta(s) = \sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{n^s}
$$

<Heading h2>Tips for writing documentation</Heading>

- Split you content into sections which are short and easy to read.
- If you are referring to project outside of the organization, you should cite your
reference with either:
   - a footnote
   - or a inline link
- Always highlight your code blocks! It makes it that much easier to read your code.
- Make sure the article is as concise as possible. Try to remove as much as content
as you can while keeping it's readability.

<Heading h2>Requesting an Article</Heading>

All of our repositories have templates for submitting issues. Make sure to read each
requirement carefully before suggesting an issue.
