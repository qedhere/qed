<Heading h2> Reporting Security Issues </Heading>

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in QED, we encourage you to let us know right away.
We will investigate all legitimate reports and do our best to quickly fix the problem.

Email `qedhere@outlook.com` to disclose any security vulnerabilities.

<Heading h2> Branch Protection </Heading>

All of our repositories have the `main` branch being protected. This means that
you cannot commit directly to `main` (this applies to code-owners/admin as well). To create a commit you have
to start a pull request and propose your changes.

From here your code will be reviewed by a code reviewer and once all checks pass,
it will be merged with the main branch.
